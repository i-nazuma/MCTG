# Monster Card Trading Game

### This is a software engineering project for my third semester in Computer Science, a Java REST API BattleGame with a persistent postgreSQL database without any helper frameworks. It merely uses Maven, Jackson, JUnit as well as the Bootstrap Framework for an additional frontend feature!

## To use/test it:
1. Firstly setup the project (import manually or use Maven by importing the project through the pom.xml File)
2. I would recommend using the provided batch/curl script to get a feel for the application. Just run the Main Class, make sure the given port is open.
3. The Scoreboard and the Battle Log are requested preferably through Postman since the Responses are written in HTML instead of JSON, or any tool that allows looking at the HTML-Response after semding a Request in a nicer way than the shell.
